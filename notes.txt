TODO DEV
    press for params
      press mode for params - apply vibrato & bend on press & remove on release
        params (10):
          volume, glide
          vibrato depth, vibrato rate
          delay time, delay repeat
          attack, release
          2 more...?
      OK:
        choose param with: zxcvb & asdfg
        apply value with: qwert & 23456
        SET the value with SHIFT & zxcvb asdfg


  Major Features
    non-traveling mode
    persist
      for which you'll need a good refactor



  REFACTOR
    left/right-up into one function?
      how with params press affect this?

  HMMM...
    sharp/flat display...?

  TODO DEV Other
    +/- and 1/2 raise/lower volume for a synth!
    Tuning (needs UI)
    shift-space resets base to C3 (later can be adjustable)
    ctrl-z (or something) to go back to last note you played
    add wave option for params
    in Hold mode, set holding to false when switching synth (or set false on old synth and start other)

  DEV QUESTIONS
    render efficiency
      'piece by piece' approach (updatePitches1View) vs rerendering in whole chunks ('initView')
        latter approach is easier but where does performance become an issue?
        how to best organize/manage in areas where there are a lot of targeted rendering calls
        or maybe just use Vue, dude.

    managing lots of conditional logic here...
    referencing things eg: model.state[synth] where synth is received from argument
      synth1, param1, multiple usages confusing. eg: uses in the view
      OR state[synthNum].params[state[synthNum].editingParam] = value
      OR } else if ( (state.synth1.editingParam==='Portamento' && pressed in constants.portamento_keys) ||
        somehow seems fishy
      *OR* perfect example, Model.changeSustainMode receives 'leftHand' or 'rightHand',
        which is used directly to refer to state.leftHand / rightHand
        which seems fine here, but in a big app it seems like...
        can you keep everything that well organized so that you know what's going where?
    naming of model.setLeft/RightHand - it's calling the View, not just setting
    general naming strategies/conventions

    ? https://medium.com/edge-coders/coding-tip-try-to-code-without-if-statements-d06799eed231
    sustain mode (pluck, press, hold)
      it's a little strange to publish 'synth1HoldingToggled' things when otherwise play() is called from main
      could there be some problem with shift-keys calling setPitchAndPressed (ie: interference with 'pressed'?)

  FORK
    Keypress shifted keys: thinks shift-, is shift-<, likewise with period (.)

  KeyDown vs Up...
    so just add an on_keyup to listeners with a zone for that
    probs won't change interpretKeypress much.
    you'll need a .stop method on Audio
    audio will do conditionally depending on mode
    is it a problem to call .stop in interpretKeypress? (to triggerRelease on a triggerAttackReleased synth?)
      if so you can either send .stop conditionally or just block it in Audio



TWO SYNTHS:
  with interpretKeypress it seems we could make a more general case
    to accommodate more diverse options like two synths.
    ie: left -> doWhatLeftHandDoes, right -> doWhatRightHandDoes
  UI
    (ctrl: q: start/stop recording)
    ctrl...  a: toggle lh synth, s: toggle lh params, d: toggle rh synth, f: toggle rh params
    ctrl... z: swap hands, x: lh s1 rh p1, c: lh s2 rh p2, v: lh p1 rh s1, b: lh p2 rh s2
    ctrl l: link/unlink synths,
    ctrl space: switch spacebar hand

LINK SYNTHS/PARAMS
    you should be able to play both synths (simultaneously) with just one hand!
    So can you do both params with one hand?
      trickier - not all params will work for both...
      but maybe that's ok. like you can still edit a fmsynth param on a regular synth, it just doesn't do anything
      but reading them, hmmm. then each hand needs two displays.
      but it doesn't. each hand displays itself, and when synth/params are linked, the active hand controls the other as it's able.
      JUST DO one 'thing' for each hand'
      AND have a 'play both' or 'link synths' option so both are played (by either hand)

TODO
  - add synth options
  - add gain options

seems like there was some thought that the whole left/right hand listeners might be refactored...


how to:
  keyup & keydown
    will need a "down" handler as usual




expressive split qwerty
!yes! - think ("vim-style") where a current pitch is moved around by interval, rather than playing a specific note :
(Enter) option to trigger & hold note
(Tab) toggles Mode where the base pitch stays fixed (on spacebar)
off-hand controls
can port a mento be adjusted while a note is held?
https://noisehack.com/how-to-build-supersaw-synth-web-audio-api/





mode shifting:
  trigger modes:
    triggerAttackRelease
    triggerAttack/triggerRelease
    note sustain - space to turn on/off
  pitch selection:
    moving root
    fixed root (in note sustain mode: space returns to root note, any same pitch toggles on/off on second press)
      do you want to have note sustain mode in fixed root mode at all...

"shift" modifier - moves root pitch without triggering note (in any mode)


sculpt hand hmm: param editing vs key-responsive sound manipulation?

tab/enter/etc. to toggle 'boards'

Board 1:
  Port | Vibrato | Gain | Synthtype
Board 2:
  Attack | Decay | Sustain | Release

PARAM TREE:
  basic
    gain portamento detune
  synth type
    saw sin tri etc...
  envelope
    adsr
  effects
    vibrato
    filter
    tremolo
    chorus
    phaser
    delay
      delay on/off delay time delay feed
  presets

pitch bend with .detune and linearRampToValueAtTime : https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Signals

hmm:
  may want a modifiable "reset" quick fix in case you get lost.
    (eg: ctrl-x sets note to C3)


parking lot:
  FEATURE make-your own presets
  polysynth - possible issue with which-note-is-released? or maybe not. I think triggerRelease accepts a note.
  FEATURE wherein base note of one hand (with fixed base) tracks to other hand,
    enabling ez-harmonies.
